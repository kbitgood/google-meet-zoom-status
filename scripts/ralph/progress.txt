# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-24
Feature: Google Meet to Zoom Status Chrome Extension
Parent Task: google-meet-zoom-status

## Codebase Patterns
(Patterns discovered during this feature build)

- TypeScript with ES2022 target and strict mode
- esbuild for bundling (not webpack/vite)
- Chrome extension Manifest V3 structure
- Entry points: background/index.ts, content/index.ts, popup/index.ts
- Shared types in src/types.ts

## P0-1: Initialize Project Structure
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Date:** 2026-01-24

### What was done:
- Created `package.json` with scripts: build, build:watch, typecheck
- Dependencies: esbuild, typescript, @types/chrome
- Created `tsconfig.json` with strict TypeScript settings (ES2022, bundler resolution)
- Created `build.js` using esbuild to bundle 3 entry points to dist/
- Created directory structure:
  - `src/background/index.ts` - Service worker entry
  - `src/content/index.ts` - Content script entry
  - `src/popup/index.ts` - Popup script entry
  - `src/types.ts` - Shared TypeScript types (ZoomPresenceStatus, MeetingState, ExtensionMessage, etc.)
  - `public/manifest.json` - Chrome extension manifest v3
  - `public/popup.html` - Popup HTML
  - `public/popup.css` - Popup styles
  - `public/icons/` - Placeholder icons (16, 48, 128)
- Created `.gitignore` for node_modules, dist, env files

### Verification:
- `npm install` - SUCCESS
- `npm run build` - SUCCESS (creates dist/ with bundled files)
- `npm run typecheck` - SUCCESS (no errors)

## P0-2: Create Chrome Extension Manifest and Base Files
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Date:** 2026-01-24

### What was done:
- Most files were already created by P0-1 (good overlap in task definitions)
- Added `activeTab` permission to manifest.json (was missing from task requirements)
- Verified all required components exist:
  - `public/manifest.json` - Manifest V3 with all required permissions
  - `public/popup.html` - Popup with minimal structure
  - `src/background/index.ts` - Service worker entry point
  - `src/content/index.ts` - Content script entry point
  - `src/popup/index.ts` - Popup script entry point
- All permissions configured: `tabs`, `storage`, `identity`, `activeTab`
- Host permissions: `https://meet.google.com/*`, `https://api.zoom.us/*`
- Content script configured for meet.google.com with `run_at: document_idle`
- Background service worker configured with `type: module`

### Verification:
- `npm run typecheck` - SUCCESS
- `npm run build` - SUCCESS (dist/ contains all extension files)
- Extension structure matches Manifest V3 requirements
